# Strava Activity Data Tracking

After adopting my dog, I realized that I would be engaging in a variety of activities—running, hiking, and long walks. To ensure I’m using the right shoes and preventing injuries, I needed a way to track my shoe mileage over time.

This project includes the **Strava Data ETL Script** that I use to collect activity data from Strava and load it into a **PostgreSQL** database. With this data, I can:

- Explore various activities I've done with my dog or by myself.
- Keep track of the mileage on each pair of shoes to prevent overuse injuries.

## Features
- Extracts activity data from Strava's API.
- Loads structured data into a PostgreSQL database.
- Enables analysis of activity trends and shoe mileage tracking.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- Strava API credentials

This project helps me stay injury-free while enjoying an active lifestyle with my dog! 🐶🏃‍♂️ It also helps me keep track of my story with my dog since I have maintained the postgres database since I've adopted her.
